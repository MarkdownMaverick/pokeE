> **`pokeE`** is a GBA ROM hack base that equips **developers** with a comprehensive toolkit for creating Pokémon ROM hacks. **It is not a playable Pokémon game on its own.**
> ---
> ## 🔥 This is a custom fork of rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion, which itself is a fork of DizzyEggg/pokeemerald.
Several features have been removed or altered to fit my custom storyline, including gender selection, name entry, and the intro sequence.
I'm a beginner coder working with PoryScript and PoryMap, so there may be bugs or inconsistencies 💀. For the full feature set and original content, please visit the original repository.

> ## ⚠️ *I'm a beginner coder working with this project, so I'm still learning how to use and modify it.*
**Want to follow along or steal code?**
>  Feel free 🤷, Just please remember this is a learning project things will break, get reverted, and change dramatically from one day to the next.
### Current state of the project
- Instant intro skip (spawn straight on the docks as KAI)  
 Custom starting map: AA_DOCKS  
 All vanilla intro flags set automatically on new game  
 debug NPCs (like debugachu) to verify everything works
